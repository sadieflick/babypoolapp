# Guest Login Flow Audit Results

## Issue Summary
The guest login flow is not correctly transitioning from the event code form to the name-only form, despite the backend correctly returning a `need_name_only` status.

## Key Findings

1. **Backend API Analysis**
   - The backend API correctly returns `need_name_only` status when an event code is submitted
   - The response contains the expected data: event_id, event_title, message, and status

2. **Component Implementation Analysis**
   - The GuestLogin component has been refactored to use useReducer instead of multiple useState hooks
   - The reducer function properly handles the 'HANDLE_NEED_NAME_ONLY' action and updates state correctly
   - The NameOnlyForm component exists and is correctly implemented
   - All required props are defined in the NameOnlyForm interface

3. **State Transition Analysis**
   - Our diagnostic test confirms that in isolation, the state transitions correctly when processing the API response
   - The form step changes to 'name-only' and the selectedEvent is set properly

4. **Build Process Analysis**
   - The App.js file exists in the repository
   - The build process appears to be using a different approach than expected
   - GuestLogin component doesn't appear to be directly referenced in build_frontend.py

## Likely Causes

1. **Client-Side Routing Issues**
   - The application may not be correctly handling routes for the React SPA
   - The build process doesn't explicitly include the GuestLogin component

2. **React Component Loading Issues**
   - React may be rendering a cached version of the component
   - The compiled frontend may not include the latest changes to GuestLogin.js

3. **State Persistence Problems**
   - React dev tools show the state transitions are firing but component isn't re-rendering
   - Browser may be caching old JavaScript files

## Recommended Actions

Based on our findings, here are potential solutions (in order of likely effectiveness):

1. **Update Build Process to Include GuestLogin**
   - Ensure the build process explicitly includes GuestLogin component
   - Verify the compiled JS includes the latest component code

2. **Fix Client-Side Routing**
   - Update route handling to properly render the GuestLogin component
   - Ensure React Router (if used) is correctly configured

3. **Add Explicit SSR Support**
   - If using server-side rendering, ensure the component is properly hydrated
   - Add serverside support for the guest login path

4. **Browser Cache Clearing**
   - Add cache-busting headers to the server responses
   - Force refresh of JavaScript files
